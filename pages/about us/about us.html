                <h4>The History Of Handloom</h4>
                <p>In the olden times, people actively used charkha for spinning cotton to make it a fabric. In each and every village of India, a separate weavers community was present which produced Handwoven and Handspun fabrics from small instruments like Charkhas. But due to British rule, many things turned upside down for the handloom sector of our country. </p>

                    <p>A ‘handloom’ is a loom that is used to weave cloth without the use of any electricity. Hand weaving is done on pit looms or frame looms generally located in weavers’ homes. Weaving is primarily the interlacing of two sets of yarn – the warp (length) and the weft (width). The equipment that facilitates this interlacing is the loom.</p>

                <h3>Advantages of handloom cotton</h3>
                <p>The handloom experience (soft, comfortable and durable) is due to the human handling of the yarn in the weaving process. As a result, yarn and the fabric are much less stressed and damaged. Hand woven cotton is known for its breathability as compared to mill made cotton. This implies that it allows more air penetration making it cooler, softer and more absorbent. It keeps you cooler in summers and warm in winters.

                    <p>Yarn, in the hank form, is used typically in handlooms. A “hank” is a specific length of yarn that is in a coiled form. A hank of cotton yarn is 840 yards long. Hank yarn is used in handloom production as opposed to cone yarn, which is used in mill production.</p>

                <div class="drying-content">
                    <p>For handloom production, yarn is colored / dyed in the hank form. Yarn dyeing for handlooms is a crucial pre loom activity. Although the handloom sector is decentralized in nature, dyeing with chemical colours has emerged as one of the centralized activities in the last 50 years. Dyeing is still carried out in the village or centres which are close to the weaving activity.

                        Colorants, or dyes as they are commonly known, are highly colored substances that impart color to a wide variety of materials. Natural and chemical colorants are used to dye hanks. This process of dyeing is done by hand, in small lots.
        
                        Dyeing in handloom sector is done in small to medium sized dye houses situated in the village. The dye houses are equipped to dye small and large quantities of yarn.</p>

                <h3>Chemical dyeing</h3>
                <p>
                    The most significant step for chemical dyeing was the discovery of the structure of benzene in 1865. This had a huge impact on the development of organic chemistry and the dyestuff industry. This was followed steadily through the years up to 1956 with the discovery of a large number of chemicals dyes that are used by the textile industry today. To meet the market demand of bright colors, especially greenish yellows, turquoise or greenish blue, scarlets and reds, “Reactive” dyes were developed in 1956. This dye group offering bright hues along with good fastness qualities and ease of application process soon became a big commercial success and hugely impacted the textile industry throughout the world.<br>
                    <br>
    
                    <b>Mordant:</b>
                    It is generally a chemical substance that helps fix colour or bind the dye (colour) to the fibre.<br>
    
                    Direct dyes: This is a dye class based on the method of application method. Here the fibre is immersed in a dye without the need for a mordant. Therefore direct dyes have high substantivity, but bond weakly to fibres, and usually have poor wash fastness.<br>
                    <br>
    
                    <b>Sulphur dyes:</b>
                    These are dyes made by reacting sulphur with organic compounds. Sulphur dyes are typically inexpensive, but dull in color. They are often used commercially to produce a good black colour at low cost on cottons. They generally have good wash fastness, but are sensitive to bleaches. Sulphur dyes on fabric, particularly some blacks, may decompose under warm, humid conditions, reducing fabric strength.<br>
                    <br>
    
                    <b>Reactive dyes:</b>
                    This dye family contains no heavy extractable metals or other known toxic substances or pollutants, making them environmentally friendly or azo free chemical dyes. These dyes are low-impact synthetic dyes that directly form covalent bonds with cotton fibres rather than merely remaining as an independent chemical entity within the fibre, thus resulting in a long lasting, fast and bright color.<br>
                    <br>
    
                    <b>Vat dyes:</b> Vat means a vessel. Vat dyes derive their name from indigo vats used for fermenting the blue indigo dye. Vat dyes are water insolubleand need a special process to fix colour on the fibre. These dyes can be used effectively on natural plant material. Brilliant colours which are light and colour fast can be obtained in vat dyes. Indigo, the blue of blue jeans, is a common vat dye.

                <div class="drying-content">
                    <p>Natural dyes are dyes that are extracted from bark of trees, insects, flowers, minerals, rust and other natural materials. Vegetable dyes are a sub-category of natural dyes referring to those that come from plant matter only. Wool is generally the best fiber to color with natural dyes. It will attach to a wider variety of dye chemicals than cellulose fibers such as cotton, and, since it is usually washed in cool water, or only dry-cleaned, the relative impermanence of most natural dyes is less of an issue.

                        Cotton is less suitable for many natural dyes. There are some natural dyes that will work on cotton especially if mordanted with tannins. Among the better natural dyes for cotton are annato, cutch, logwood, madder, and indigo. All of these except for indigo require mordants, while indigo requires a special type of dye vat.
        
                        Synthetic fibers usually cannot be dyed with natural dyes.</p>

                        Indigo dyeing was one of the first specialty professions in manufacturing of textiles. It contains neither harsh chemicals nor toxic metals. It can be used to dye any natural fibre. The use of indigo dyeing goes back to 2000B.C<br>
                        <br>

                        Indigo is a dye different than any other. First step in the process “reduces” the indigo, changing it from blue to yellow. When the yarn is worked in the solution, or “vat” and brought out to the air, it is a bright green. Slowly the air changes it to the beautiful deep and rich blue of Indigo. Indigo in some form was used in all traditional cultures, for it is the only clear and fast natural blue..</p>

                    <p>Warping is a process, which converts the hank yarn into a linear form to give the length on the loom.

                <div class="drying-content">
                    <p>After warping is done, the warp is stretched out and sizing material is applied to add strength to the yarn and lubricate it to withstand the rigors of weaving. Natural adhesives like rice, maize, wheat flour or potato starch are used depending upon the availability and region. In most handloom centers rice starch / gruel is mixed with coconut / groundnut oil and applied as sizing material.This activity of starching the yarn for weaving is known as “sizing”. This starch in the yarn is removed only after two to three washes of the woven product. Sizing process is only done on single count yarn, which is woven on pit looms.

                        Sizing is either carried out by the weavers or by skilled groups in the village. . Since this activity is carried out on the street, this is referred to as “street sizing”.</p>

                    <p>Pit loom, stand loom and frame loom are three kinds of looms predominantly used by handloom weavers. The Pit loom is a loom situated on the ground / floor with a pit having two peddles set in the pit for the weaver to operate. Pit loom weaving is considered to be better weaving as the fabric woven retains the character of the fiber and fabric due to the proximity to the ground. The ground absorbs the tension and speed and makes the fabric more breathable.</p>

                <h3>Weaving techniques</h3>
                <p>
                    Different techniques are used for weaving on the loom. There is a basic weaving technique which makes the fabric. There are others, which are used to create surface designs on the fabric.<br>
                    <br>

                    Plain weave is the most commonly used technique to weave fabric on pit looms. Design and variety in fabric woven with plain weave is created through texture, stripe and check. Texture is created by using different thicknesses of yarns. Stripes and checks are created by colour or by using different thicknesses in yarn.<br>
                    <br>
        
                    Extra warp and weft techniques are also used to create designs / surface patterns on the fabric. Traditionally, borders were used in sarees and dhoties and most of the looms wove petu, a dobby technique with aextra warp for creating patterns in the borders.<br>

                        Khadi fabric is woven mostly in KVIC (Khadi Village Industries Commission) institutions located in villages across the country. Yarn is spun by hand and fabric is woven using this yarn on a handloom in these institutions. Most of the Khadi production is sold through KVIC outlets. Few individual organizations buy these fabrics from Khadi institutions and sell from their outlets.<br>
                        <br>

                        The weavers mostly weave from their homes, at times from centres established by the institutions. Ensuring that these institutions make Khadi fabric is one of the mandates of KVIC management</p>

                <h3>Different perceptions of handloom</h3>
                <p>
                    Handloom weaving and products have been amongst us for many centuries. In the last few decades, the distance and disconnect between the customer and weaver has increased tremendously, resulting in a many perceptions among customers today which might not be completely true.<br>
                    <br>

                    One of the main perceptions is that all cottons are woven on handlooms. This is not true, as a large amount of cotton fabric production is carried out by power looms and large mills. Most of the cotton garments available in the mainstream market are not made from hand woven fabric.<br>
                    <br>
        
                    The other perception is that handlooms should be cheaper. Handlooms apart from the cost of the raw materials include wage components for pre-loom done by hand and weaving also done by hand. Power loom and mill woven products are, in fact, cheaper than hand woven products as these processes are mechanized. One should be aware of this, before one buys handloom products.
